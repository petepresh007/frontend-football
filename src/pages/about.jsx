                I am someone that loves football. I am a chelsea fan and i frequently visit websites like goal.com and livesscores.com. <br/>
                I built this website so users can access football news and be up to date with happening trends in football.
                The website will enable users create football news. The created football news will be approved 
                by the admin.<br/>
                subsequently, livesscores update will be added to the web site
